# Battery Electrochemsitry Queries

This repository serves as a personal self-study initiative aimed at deepening my understanding of lithium-ion battery electrochemistry. Throughout this project, I aim to verify theories and obtained answers to personal questions around various topics surrounding electrochemistry in various applications of battery tech. <br>

[!] This repo is apart of a series of repositories dedicated to battery science and BMS explorations, labelled with prefix "battery-".

## Objectives (aimed at addressing areas for self-improvement)

- **Learn**: Gain supporting knowledge around personal questions and curiosities to supplement my own battery experience.
- **Account for Real Life**: Explore how to work with real-world battery datasets with variable quality to validate theories with data.
- **Avoid obsolence**: Testing either recent software solutions or published theories from papers to calibrate understanding to latest global view.

## Project Structure

This project is organized into several directories, each serving a specific purpose:
```
    battery-electrochemistry-queries/
    ├── query_notebooks/     # Directory for storing notebooks. EACH notebooks is a query with supported data
    │   └── XYZ.ipynb        # Why is XYZ?
    ├── README.md            # Project overview and documentation
    └── requirements.txt     # List of dependencies required to run the project
```
## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run this project, you will need Python installed on your machine along with the required libraries. Current version utilizations neing utilzied locally are as follows:
- Python (3.11.7)
- Virtual environment created using Python 3.11 (Not required but suggested)

Otherwise, you can install the dependencies using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
