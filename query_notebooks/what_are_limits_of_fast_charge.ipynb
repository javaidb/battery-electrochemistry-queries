    "## Purpose\n",
    "[!] This notebook is apart of a series of queries aimed at answering personal questions with supported physics-based models designed to further extend experience, knowledge and application of electrochemsitry across various battery contexts. <br>\n",
    "For the query outlined: We aim to understand the limits of fast charge based on research and supporting theories with modeled data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Description\n",
    "In this notebook, we will:\n",
    "- **Import necessary libraries**: Load essential Python libraries, primarily PyBaMM for supported physics-based analyses.\n",
    "- **Lay out queries**: Outline questions and procured answers to said questions.\n",
    "- **Verify against modeled data**: Support various queries with modeled data from PyBaMM.\n",
    "- **Visualization**: Create visual representations of the results to enhance understanding.\n",
